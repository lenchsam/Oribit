 - Visual Studio Code (or your preferred)

### Setup
 1. Clone the repository. 
 2. Open the project using Unity Hub.
 3. Navigate to the `Assets -> Scenes` folder and open the **SampleScene** scene.
 4. Experiment and explore the project!

### Common Issues
As of writing this i havent found any, but if you have an issue feel free to email me using the email at the bottom of this readme.

## Potential Future Features
Should this be taken further, here are some of the extra mechanics or features that may be put in.

 - Ads
 - Coins for the player to collect while playing
 - A shop for these coins to be spent on
